    <h2>
      Technical and organizational measures in accordance to Art. 32 GDPR (Art. 28 Para. 3 Sent. 2 Clause c of the GDPR)
    </h2>
    <p class="item">
      Before the commencement of data processing, the Supplier shall document the execution of the necessary Technical and organizational measures defined in advance of the execution of the Contract, specifically with regard to the detailed execution of the Agreement or Contract, and shall present these documented measures to the Client for inspection (See Appendix 2 of this document). Upon acceptance of said documents by the Client, the documented measures become the foundation of the this Agreement. Insofar as the inspection/audit by the Client shows the need for amendments, such amendments shall be implemented by mutual agreement.
    </p>
    <p class="item">
      The Supplier shall establish the security of the data in accordance with Art. 28 Para. 3 Sent. 2 Clause c, and Art. 32 GDPR in particular in conjunction with Art. 5 Para. 1 and Para. 2 GDPR. The measures to be taken are measures of data security and measures that guarantee a protection level appropriate to the risk concerning confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of the systems. The state of the technology; implementation costs; the nature, scope, and purposes of processing; as well as the probability of occurrence and the severity of the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons within the scope of Art. 32 Para. 1 GDPR must be taken into account.
    </p>
    <p class="item">
      The technical and organizational measures shall be subject to technical progress and further development. In this respect, the Supplier is permitted to implement alternative adequate measures. The safety level of the specified measures must not be compromised. Substantial changes shall be documented.
    </p>
    <h2>Correction, restriction, and deletion of data</h2>
    <p class="item">
      The Supplier is not entitled of his own authority to delete or restrict the processing of data processed on behalf of third parties. Insofar as an Affected Person contacts the Supplier directly in this respect, the Supplier will immediately forward this request to the Client without delay.
    </p>
    <p class="item">
      Insofar as the scope of services under the Contract and this Agreement includes, the following are to be ensured without undue delay by the Supplier in accordance with the Client’s documented instructions: a deletion policy, the “right to be forgotten”, data correction, data portability, and data disclosure. However, the Supplier may claim compensation for such services provided to the Client on the basis of hourly rate as stipulated in Article 11.1 of this Agreement.
    </p>
    <h2>Quality assurance and other duties of the Supplier</h2>
    <p>
      In addition to complying with the provisions of this Agreement, the Supplier shall comply with statutory obligations in accordance with Articles 28 to 33 GDPR; in this respect, the Supplier shall particularly ensure compliance with the following requirements:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Benjamin Alan Jamie (<a href="mailto:privacy@weblate.org">privacy@weblate.org</a>) is appointed to the role of Data Protection Officer by the Supplier. The Client shall be immediately notified of any change of the Data Protection Officer. The Data Protection Officer's current contact details are easily accessible on the Supplier's website.
      </li>
      <li>
        Confidentiality in accordance with Art. 28 Para. 3 Sent. 2 Clause b, Art. 29 and Art. 32 Para. 4 GDPR. The Supplier entrusts only such employees or subcontractors with the data processing defined in this Agreement who have been bound to confidentiality and have previously been familiarized with the data protection provisions relevant to their work. The Supplier and any person acting under its authority who has access to personal data may only process that data in accordance with the instructions of the Client (which includes the powers granted in this Agreement) unless otherwise required to do so by law.
      </li>
      <li>
        The implementation and observance of all technical and organizational measures necessary for this Agreement in accordance with Art. 28 Para. 3 Sent. 2 Clause c, Art. 32 GDPR are specified in Appendix 2 of this Agreement.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Supplier and the Client shall, upon request, cooperate with the supervisory authority in the performance of their duties.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Client shall be informed immediately of any inspections and measures conducted by the supervisory authority, insofar as they relate to this Agreement or Contract. This also applies insofar as the Supplier is under investigation or is party to an investigation by a competent authority in connection with infringements to any civil or criminal law, administrative rule, or regulation regarding the processing of personal data in connection with the processing of this Agreement or Contract.
      </li>
      <li>
        Insofar as the Client is subject to an inspection by the supervisory authority, an administrative or summary offence or criminal procedure, a liability claim of an Affected Person or a third party or any other claim in connection with the processing of the Agreement or Contract by the Supplier, the Supplier shall make reasonable effort to support the Client in such inspection provided that adequate reimbursement of costs to the Supplier is provided.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Supplier shall regularly monitor the internal processes as well as the Technical and organizational measures to ensure that the processing in his area of responsibility is executed in accordance with the requirements of the applicable data protection law and that the rights of the Affected People are protected.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Subcontractors</h2>
    <p>
      For the purposes of this Agreement, subcontracting relationships are defined as those services which relate directly to the provision of the principal commission. This does not include ancillary services which the Supplier uses, e.g. telecommunications services; postal/transport services; maintenance and user support services; as well as other measures to ensure the confidentiality, availability, integrity and resilience of the hardware and software of data processing systems. However, the Supplier is obligated to make appropriate and legally binding contractual arrangements and implement appropriate inspection measures to guarantee data protection and data security of the Client's data, even in the case of outsourced ancillary services. An up to date list of the subcontractors can be found at: <a href="https://hosted.weblate.org/legal/contracts/">https://hosted.weblate.org/legal/contracts/</a>.

    </p>
    <p class="item">
      The Supplier shall ensure that the Client can verify the Supplier's compliance with the obligations under Article 28 of the GDPR. The Supplier is obligated to provide the Client with the necessary information upon request and in particular to provide proof of the implementation of the Technical and organizational measures.
    </p>
    <p class="item">
      Evidence of such measures which concern not only this specific Agreement or Contract may be provided by compliance with approved codes of conduct pursuant to Article 40 GDPR; certification according to an approved certification procedure in accordance with Article 42 GDPR; current auditor’s certificates, reports, or excerpts from reports provided by independent bodies (e.g. an auditor, Data Protection Officer, IT security department, data privacy auditor, quality auditor); or a suitable certification by IT security or data protection auditing. The Client, however, acknowledges that the Supplier does not implement any approved codes of conduct within the meaning of Article 40 GDPR at the time of conclusion of the Agreement.
