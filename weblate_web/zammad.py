Thank you for purchasing a dedicated Weblate instance! We will prepare it promptly after you provide the information below.

If you want to use your own domain, please create a CNAME DNS entry to {domain}.weblate.cloud and let us know.
Your weblate.cloud domain name can also be changed; if the one mentioned above doesn't fit you, tell us.

In case you would like to use another authentication method(s) than the native username+password login, please provide us credentials for your chosen method.
You can check available options like GitHub, OAuth, SAML, Azure AD, and many more at https://docs.weblate.org/en/latest/admin/auth.html#social-authentication.

It is also possible to keep settings default and customize anything later. It’s your instance, your choice. We will also gladly help with any of your Weblate questions; please don’t hesitate to ask by replying to this message.

Kind regards from Weblate
